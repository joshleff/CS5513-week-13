# Headless CMS App
In this assignment,
I used **SFTP** to update a **PHP** functions file
on my **Pantheon** hosted **Wordpress** site,
creating custom **SQL** queries to return **JSON** formatted data at a unique **REST** endpoint url.
The data from that endpoint is then displayed on a basic **Next.js** app,
written in **Javascript** and using **React** components.
It was then deployed to **Vercel**.
